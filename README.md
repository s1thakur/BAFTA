BUSINESS ANALYSIS


OBJECTIVE:

To create descriptive reports that will help us find the most popular food items and truck locations. The goal is to help food truck owners increase their profits.

PROBLEM: 

Currently each food truck owner acts independently and only have information on their own sales. This makes it harder for each food truck to visualize trends of popular items and locations. BAFTA would like to help enhance their sales by aggregating all food truck information to view the overall trends.

INTRODUCTION:

The Bay Area Food Truck Association (BAFTA) is an organization which hosts a network of local food truck businesses in the Bay Area. BAFTA invites independent truck owners to join the association to work together as one community. It collects data from all the food trucks associated with it and performs descriptive analysis to provide insights on their food types and location choices so that they can make better decisions to increase their customer base and expand their business. 

USER STORY:

Cindy comes home from her job at 7 PM and invites her friends over for a movie at 8 PM. It is a Friday night and she just wants to relax as it has been a long work week. She feels too lazy to cook for everyone, so she decides to order from a food truck. She opens the BAFTA app on her phone, selects her favorite food truck “Taco Guys” and orders 6 tacos ($1.83 each) and 6 Cheese Quesadilla ($4.95 each). After she places her order, the total cost is $40.68. Taco Guys confirm the order and send an invoice to Cindy, who then pays through the mobile app. The food truck sends a notification to pick-up the food when it’s ready. Cindy shows her invoice at the location and picks up her order.

BUSINESS PROCESS:

1.	Customer orders food through the mobile app. He/she will make his/her selection based on preferred food group and/or pick-up location
2.	Since inventory/availability of menu items are updated real time through the app from the food truck’s side, the customer will become notified if a certain item is no longer available. In this case, the customer makes a different item selection. 
3.	Food truck receives and confirms order. Mobile app delivers invoice to customer
4.	Customer makes payment through mobile app
5.	Food truck owner fulfills order and customer picks up food at selected location
6.	Data goes to repository/data warehouse
7.	BAFTA members query data to create reports such as the following:
Report types:
a.	Popular food categories
b.	Popular ordering times
c.	Popular locations
d.	Prescribe the most profitable business plan for  food truck owners
8.	BAFTA shares information with food truck owner; periodic reports are generated and delivered to food truck drivers through their dashboard.
9.	Food truck owner makes business decision to better meet demand and as a result increase profitability. For example, they can see the location and time of popular pick-up locations and set their schedule for the week.
